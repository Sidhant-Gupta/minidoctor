Hackers: Sidhant Gupta and Sejal Gupta

The aim of this project focuses on connecting the dots between the patients, doctors and pharmacies.This android application dissolves the tough boundary between them. We aim to resolve this non-linearity in the hierarchy by creating a mobile application based system, which will be centralized. As the private healthcare sector is highly unregulated, this project will bring uniformity in healthcare sectors to come under one umbrella.

##Backend:Nodejs, ExpressJS, PostgresQL
